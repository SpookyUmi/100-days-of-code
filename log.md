# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started a new challenge from Frontend Mentor. I worked my CSS and tried new functions such as `fit-content` and `text-indent` !

**Thoughts:** I struggled with CSS but I kept my motivation and worked until I had a nice result.

### Day 01: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I learnt different ways to write a function in JS (thanks to Wes Bos beginner javascript course). Also continued my Frontend Mentor challenge and took a little time to rest !

**Thoughts**: I'm sure JS will become more complex day after day, but I love it and I feel so thrilled to begin to learn that language !


### Day 02: April 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I wasn't really productive but I continued the Frontend mentor challenge. I worked on the responsive part and especially on a grid item using `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties.

**Thoughts**: I felt a bit guilty to take a break but I made up my mind : It can be benefit sometime ! And my motivation to code and to learn more and more isn't gone at all, I really enjoy this journey.
