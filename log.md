# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started a new challenge from Frontend Mentor. I worked my CSS and tried new functions such as `fit-content` and `text-indent` !

**Thoughts:** I struggled with CSS but I kept my motivation and worked until I had a nice result.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
