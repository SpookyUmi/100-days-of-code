# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started a new challenge from Frontend Mentor. I worked my CSS and tried new functions such as `fit-content` and `text-indent` !

**Thoughts:** I struggled with CSS but I kept my motivation and worked until I had a nice result.

### Day 01: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I learnt different ways to write a function in JS (thanks to Wes Bos beginner javascript course). Also continued my Frontend Mentor challenge and took a little time to rest !

**Thoughts**: I'm sure JS will become more complex day after day, but I love it and I feel so thrilled to begin to learn that language !


### Day 02: April 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I wasn't really productive but I continued the Frontend mentor challenge. I worked on the responsive part and especially on a grid item using `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties.

**Thoughts**: I felt a bit guilty to take a break but I made up my mind : It can be benefit sometime ! And my motivation to code and to learn more and more isn't gone at all, I really enjoy this journey.


### Day 03: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 2 major news :
- I learnt how to use the debugger through Firefox devtools (thanks to Wes Bos' JS beginner course)
- I also improved my CSS skills using an association of CSSgrid and Flexbox for my <!-- almost finished --> Frontend Mentor challenge, to organize the `.topar`, `.form` and `.footer`. Also used for the first time `last-of-type`, `nth-child` and `first-of-type` properties. I tried many configurations and searched on MDN to be sure, and I finally found how to use it properly.

**Thoughts**: I was more productive today and almost finished my challenge, so I felt really good ! Surprisingly, mondays can be pleasant.


### Day 04: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Frontend Mentor challenge !! So satisfied. The JS part isn't ready yet, I'm still learning, it'll be set up in a few weeks.

**Thoughts**: I feel satisfied and happy of this challenge's result. I worked hard on it and it allowed me to train my HTML and CSS skills. I'm still learning CSSgrid but I already used some of its properties.

### Day 05: April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Jumped right into a new Frontend Mentor challenge just to practice with a CSS framework : Bootstrap. I also continue my JS course.

**Thoughts**: I must say that I'm not a huge fan of Bootstrap, I find it really limited, but it's necessary to know how to work with such a famous tool.


### Day 06: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Pursuing my Frontend Mentor challenge with bootstrap and struggling hard with it... CSS vanilla miss me ! Also pursuing my JS course and love it ! I reached module #4 of Wes Bos' course, which introduces the DOM.

**Thoughts**: I'm happy to learn JS and I'm starting to see all the possibilities that this language offers.


### Day 07: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: i'm starting to really understand the DOM and how to interact with it. Also went for an inline skating session and worked on my bootstrap challenge.

**Thoughts**: I was glad to find some time to do sport.


### Day 08: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did Wes Bos' JS DOM cardio exercise and struggled a lot, I wasn't in a good mood. But I almost succeed the challenge and finished the exercise !

**Thoughts**: I found the exercise interesting but also difficult. Took more time to relax today.


### Day 09: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Pursuing Wes Bos' CSSgrid course.

**Thoughts**: It's sunday ! I took time to inline skate and to draw.
